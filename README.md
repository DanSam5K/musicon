# About musicon project
In this project, I will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. I will incorporate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!

Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page.
